I have created a data visualization (Report) that provides insights into sales performance, customer orders, and profitability trends based on the dataset. This report helps in understanding order fulfillment efficiency, product demand, and revenue generation for better business decision-making

Interactive dashboards provide sales insights across different U.S. regions, allowing selection via the pie chart. For a more detailed view, users can drill down into individual states to extract specific insights.



Five key takeaways from the analysis and how they drive decision-making:

1) Top-Selling Products: Phones, Chairs, and Storage are the best-performing categories, guiding inventory planning and marketing efforts.
2) Regional Sales Performance: The West region contributes the highest sales, helping businesses allocate resources strategically to high-performing markets.
3) State-Level Insights: California shows the strongest sales, indicating the need for localized promotions and targeted sales strategies.
4) Seasonal Demand Trends: Sales fluctuate over time with visible peaks, aiding in optimizing pricing, stock levels, and promotional campaigns.
5) Impact of Discounts on Revenue: The comparison of MRP and post-discount sales highlights the role of pricing strategies in profitability, ensuring balanced discounting without harming margins
