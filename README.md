# Power-BI-Sales-Dashboard-Report-

I have created a data visualization (Report) that provides insights into sales performance, customer orders, and profitability trends based on the dataset. This report helps in understanding order fulfillment efficiency, product demand, and revenue generation for better business decision-making
